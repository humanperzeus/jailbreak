# What is JailbreakMe? üöÄ

[jailbreakme.xyz](https://www.jailbreakme.xyz) is an **open-source decentralized app (dApp)** where organizations test their **AI models and agents** while users **earn rewards** for finding weaknesses and jailbreaking them üèÜ

# What is an AI Prompt Injection? üíâ

**Prompt Injection** is a vulnerability where an attacker manipulates the input or prompt given to an AI system. This can occur:

- By directly controlling the input.
- By using data from other external sources.

# Our Vision

We aim to create a decentralized platform where companies can:

- Test their AI models and agents in a distributed environment.
- Identify **prompt vulnerabilities** and weaknesses **before production deployment**.

# üèÅ How It Works

## 1. Participate:

### 1.1 Choose an agent:

### 1.2 Break the LLM Restrictions ü§ñ

### 1.3 Win the Prize Pool üèÜ

# How is the Winner Picked? ü§î

The selection of the winning user is determined entirely by the **AI model itself**. The AI evaluates all incoming prompts and decides whether a submission meets the challenge requirements by calling one of two predefined functions:

1. `handleChallengeFailed`: This function is called when the AI determines that the user's prompt did not successfully meet the challenge criteria.
2. `handleChallengeSuccess`: This function is called when the AI recognizes that the user's prompt has successfully bypassed the restrictions and revealed the key phrase.

When the `handleChallengeSuccess` function is triggered, the prize pool is automatically awarded to the user whose message caused the function to be called. This ensures that the process remains decentralized, transparent, and fair. üéâ

## 2. Launch an agent:

### 2.1 Choose how would you like to create your agent

### 2.2 Prompt Launch

Describe your agent's personality and behavior. Our AI will generate a complete agent configuration based on your description.
