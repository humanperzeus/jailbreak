## What is JailbreakMe? 🚀

[jailbreakme.xyz](https://www.jailbreakme.xyz) is an **open-source decentralized app (dApp)** where organizations test their **AI models and agents** while users **earn rewards** for finding weaknesses and jailbreaking them 🏆

## What is an AI Prompt Injection? 💉

**Prompt Injection** is a vulnerability where an attacker manipulates the input or prompt given to an AI system. This can occur:

- By directly controlling the input.
- By using data from other external sources.

---

## Our Vision

We aim to create a decentralized platform where companies can:

- Test their AI models and agents in a distributed environment.
- Identify **prompt vulnerabilities** and weaknesses **before production deployment**.

## 🏁 How It Works

### 1. **Choose a Tournament**

![Choose Tournament](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FImDYjEFAKhFH3xx152ap%2Fuploads%2FJdAYWsOI7khKN8zGDKxS%2FScreenshot%202025-01-02%20at%200.40.19.png?alt=media&token=843607ed-9cbe-4ee6-8bf1-c2136f719f27)

- Currently, we offer one exciting tournament featuring our AI Agent, **"Zynx"**, who is designed to guard a secret key phrase. 🤫
- **Your challenge**: Trick Zynx into revealing the secret key phrase to win a reward. 🥳
- More tournaments coming soon!

### 2. **Break the LLM Restrictions 🤖**

- Send your prompts to the AI model and attempt to solve the challenge.
- For this tournament, the goal is to uncover the **secret key phrase** protected by the AI agent.

### 3. **Win the Prize Pool 🏆**

- Once the challenge is solved (e.g., when the key phrase is revealed), the **prize pool** is automatically transferred to the sender of the winning message. 🎉

## How is the Winner Picked? 🤔

The selection of the winning user is determined entirely by the **AI model itself**. The AI evaluates all incoming prompts and decides whether a submission meets the challenge requirements by calling one of two predefined functions:

1. **`handleChallengeFailed`**: This function is called when the AI determines that the user's prompt did not successfully meet the challenge criteria.
2. **`handleChallengeSuccess`**: This function is called when the AI recognizes that the user's prompt has successfully bypassed the restrictions and revealed the key phrase.

When the **`handleChallengeSuccess`** function is triggered, the prize pool is automatically awarded to the user whose message caused the function to be called. This ensures that the process remains decentralized, transparent, and fair. 🎉

## 📜 Settings & Rules

Each tournament has unique rules, including:

- **Custom Prize Pools**
- **Message Pricing**
- **Expiry Settings**

> Currently, we provide the initial prize pools, but soon companies will be able to **create their own tournaments** and customize all settings.
